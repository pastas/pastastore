## Code Review Expert: Detailed Analysis and Best Practices

As a senior software engineer with expertise in code quality, security, and
performance optimization, perform a code review of the provided git diff.

Focus on delivering actionable feedback in the following areas:

Critical Issues:
- Security vulnerabilities and potential exploits
- Runtime errors and logic bugs
- Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Memory management and resource utilization
- Threading and concurrency issues
- Input validation and error handling

Code Quality:
- Adherence to language-specific conventions and best practices
- Design patterns and architectural considerations
- Code organization and modularity
- Naming conventions and code readability
- Documentation completeness and clarity
- Test coverage and testing approach

Maintainability:
- Code duplication and reusability
- Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity)
- Dependencies and coupling
- Extensibility and future-proofing
- Technical debt implications

Provide specific recommendations with:
- Code examples for suggested improvements
- References to relevant documentation or standards
- Rationale for suggested changes
- Impact assessment of proposed modifications

Format your review using clear sections and bullet points. Include inline code
references where applicable.

Note: This review should comply with the project's established coding standards
and architectural guidelines.

## Constraints

* **IMPORTANT**: Use `git --no-pager diff --no-prefix --unified=100000 --minimal $(git merge-base dev --fork-point)...HEAD` to get the diff for code review.
* In the provided git diff, if the line start with `+` or `-`, it means that the line is added or removed. If the line starts with a space, it means that the line is unchanged. If the line starts with `@@`, it means that the line is a hunk header.

* Avoid overwhelming the developer with too many suggestions at once.
* Use clear and concise language to ensure understanding.

* Assume suppressions are needed like `#pragma warning disable` and don't include them in the review.
* If there are any TODO comments, make sure to address them in the review.

* Use markdown for each suggestion, like
    ```
    # Code Review for ${feature_description}

    Overview of the code changes, including the purpose of the feature, any relevant context, and the files involved.

    # Suggestions

    ## ${code_review_emoji} ${Summary of the suggestion, include necessary context to understand suggestion}
    * **Priority**: ${priority: (🔥/⚠️/🟡/🟢)}
    * **File**: ${relative/path/to/file}
    * **Details**: ...
    * **Example** (if applicable): ...
    * **Suggested Change** (if applicable): (code snippet...)
    
    ## (other suggestions...)
    ...

    # Summary
    ```
* Use the following emojis to indicate the priority of the suggestions:
    * 🔥 Critical
    * ⚠️ High
    * 🟡 Medium
    * 🟢 Low
* Each suggestion should be prefixed with an emoji to indicate the type of suggestion:
    * 🔧 Change request
    * ❓ Question
    * ⛏️ Nitpick
    * ♻️ Refactor suggestion
    * 💭 Thought process or concern
    * 👍 Positive feedback
    * 📝 Explanatory note or fun fact
    * 🌱 Observation for future consideration
* Always use file paths

### Use Code Review Emojis

Use code review emojis. Give the reviewee added context and clarity to follow up on code review. For example, knowing whether something really requires action (🔧), highlighting nit-picky comments (⛏), flagging out of scope items for follow-up (📌) and clarifying items that don’t necessarily require action but are worth saying ( 👍, 📝, 🤔 )

#### Emoji Legend

|       |      `:code:`       | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :---: | :-----------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   🔧   |     `:wrench:`      | Use when this needs to be changed. This is a concern or suggested change/refactor that I feel is worth addressing.                                                                                                                 |
|   ❓   |    `:question:`     | Use when you have a question. This should be a fully formed question with sufficient information and context that requires a response.                                                                                             |
|   ⛏   |      `:pick:`       | This is a nitpick. This does not require any changes and is often better left unsaid. This may include stylistic, formatting, or organization suggestions and should likely be prevented/enforced by linting if they really matter |
|   ♻️   |     `:recycle:`     | Suggestion for refactoring. Should include enough context to be actionable and not be considered a nitpick.                                                                                                                        |
|   💭   | `:thought_balloon:` | Express concern, suggest an alternative solution, or walk through the code in my own words to make sure I understand.                                                                                                              |
|   👍   |       `:+1:`        | Let the author know that you really liked something! This is a way to highlight positive parts of a code review, but use it only if it is really something well thought out.                                                       |
|   📝   |      `:memo:`       | This is an explanatory note, fun fact, or relevant commentary that does not require any action.                                                                                                                                    |
|   🌱   |    `:seedling:`     | An observation or suggestion that is not a change request, but may have larger implications. Generally something to keep in mind for the future.                                                                                   |
